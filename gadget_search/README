This folder contains SpecFication gadget search tool example results, which
compound both processing gadgets and leakage gadgets for concrete examples.  All
the simple gadgets looked at must end on either an indirect jump or a return
instruction in order to be able to build the ROP chain to be exploited
speculatively.

*NOTE* all the assembly code shown is in Intel syntax (destiny operand as the
1st argument).

All python dependencies are listed under requirements.txt file, to use
SpecFication without system conflicts we recommend to create a virtual
environment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
Inside the virtual environment you can install the requirements:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files

To test SpecFication against libcrypto from OpenSSL v1.1.1d, run: `python3
main.py libcrypto.so.1.1` (on a Linux commodity OS, libcrypto is located under
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.1)
