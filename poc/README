This folder contains a SMoTherSpectre-based attack which leaks full
bytes compared to single bits leaked by the original attack. It 
achieves this by shifting the secret by different widths by using
processing gadgets.

Running:
- `./run.py`

Outputs:
- Folder `data/dat-YY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`
  - Contains victim's secrets (`secret_bits.csv`), attacker's timing 
    samples (`attacker_samples.csv`) and guesses (`attacker_bit_guesses.csv`).
  - Contains a copy of the source used to generate this data in `src/` 
  - `hist.png` showing distribution of attacker timings based on victim secrets
  - Octave script `showme.m` which generates `hist.png`
- Folder `latest/` which is a symlink to the last experiment results
