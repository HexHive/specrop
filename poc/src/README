The configuration for the experiment is in `config.h`:
- `CORE0` is one logical core in a SMT processor. The other
  core used will be (`CORE0` + `NPROCS`/2). On a four core
  SMT processor, this means that the attacker and victim
  will run on cores 1 and 5 respectively.
- The attacker will get `NSAMPLES` timing samples to guess
  a single victim bit
- Each secret has `NBITS=8` bits
- There are a total of `NCHARS` secrets to be leaked
- Finally, we can choose which set of SMoTher gadgets to use
  by defining `GADGET_LAB` (a perfect, laboratory-made gadget)
  or not (uses a real life gadget from `libc`).
